## How it works

The input pins are connected to a set of different logic gates, which lead to the outputs. One logic layer, very simple.

## How to test

No clock is needed. Simply play with the inputs, and see whether you can figure out from the truth table which pis correspond to which gate.

SPOILER: The solution is:

## External hardware

Connect 16 switches to the input and multifunction pins, the 8 outputs are hooked up to one LED each.
